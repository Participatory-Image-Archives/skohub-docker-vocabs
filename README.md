# Ernst Brunner Thesaurus

The Ernst Brunner Thesaurus, created in the context of the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) project, is a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary. This repository is forked from [SkoHub Docker Vocabs](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-docker-vocabs). 

## GitHub Pages

Every time a push is made to the repository a GitHub-workflow-action is triggered to publish the most recent vocabulary to the `gh-pages`-branch, which is used by GitHub pages. It spins up a Docker-Container made out the [SkoHub-Vocabs](https://github.com/hbz/skohub-vocabs)-tool. You can have a look at the Dockerfile [at this branch of skohub-vocabs](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-vocabs/tree/docker-gh-pages).

The controlled vocabulary is published at brunner.participatory-archives.ch.
